"""Phase derivation.

The `status:` field alone cannot drive this board. In a survey of 1,449 real
TASK_FILEs, 338 (23%) declared a phase behind what the file actually contained
-- e.g. `status: planning` on a file whose `## Deploy` section already holds a
merged PR URL. That is expected rather than exceptional: when `/startproject`
runs in one agent and `/team-implement` in another, nobody owns the `status:`
line, because only `/orchestrate` ever wrote it.

So a card's column is the furthest-along of two independent signals:

  declared  -- the normalized `status:` field
  evidence  -- which process sections hold real content, plus (in files
               written before the Decision Log was dropped) which Decision
               Log entry prefixes are present

with one asymmetry: `done` is a claim about intent that no amount of file
content can prove, so only `declared` may assert it.
