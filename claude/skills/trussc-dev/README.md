# TrussC Development Skill

AI coding skill for [TrussC](https://github.com/tettou771/TrussC) — a lightweight creative coding framework based on sokol, with an API similar to openFrameworks.

## What's Included

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `SKILL.md` | Entry point — build workflow, essential patterns, common pitfalls |
| `app-lifecycle.md` | App class, window, input, math, threading, file utilities |
| `graphics.md` | Drawing primitives, Color, Image/Pixels/Texture/Fbo/Shader |
| `node-system.md` | Node/RectNode hierarchy, events, layout, UI design patterns |

## Install

### Claude Code (claude-code)

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/tettou771/trussc-dev-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/trussc-dev
```

### Cursor

Add to your skill configuration at `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/` or reference the path in your Cursor settings.

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tettou771/trussc-dev-skill.git ~/.codex/skills/trussc-dev
```

## Usage

The skill activates automatically when writing TrussC C++ code. It provides the AI with knowledge of:

- Build system (CMake presets, trusscli)
- API patterns (Node hierarchy, event-driven rendering, method chaining)
- Thread safety rules (Pixels vs Texture/Image/Fbo)
- UI widget design patterns (ScrollContainer, LayoutMod, Event/EventListener)
- 15 common pitfalls and how to avoid them
